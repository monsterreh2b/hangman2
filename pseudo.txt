on page load 

  generate a random number from 1-4

  using random number, pick the word

  count the number of letters in chosen word

  "display" the word on front as underscores (find length of word) from step 3

on input submit

validate value (need letters only, else alert please input a letter)

grab value and make all values lowercase

==


if value in "word" 

e.g value = b, word = batman

find position of b in word (e.g. index = 0) 
==

REMAINING (BELOW)***


javascript populate an array at certain positions


then populate value at
position zero (0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, pick zero).


possible?

Print out word (like cocomelon) above the dashes
with what? with dashes that are same color as background

We have the indices that match (cocomelon/c, position 0 and 3). So loop through the word and populate c at 0 and 3

const cars = [];
cars[0]= "c";
cars[3]= "c";
